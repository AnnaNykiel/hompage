    <p>When Harry woke up the next morning, it seemed to him that yesterday's events were just a dream. His conviction was further strengthened by the knock he heard. <em>He thought he was still in the cupboard under the stairs of his house at 4 Privet Drive</em>, and that noise was being made by Aunt Petunia, urging him to wake up. When he opened his eyes, however, it turned out that everything that had happened to him the previous day was true, <i>and the knocking was coming from behind the hut</i></p>
